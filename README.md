I always wanted to build a tarot reading app. An extremely simplified starting version can be seen [here](https://mchlol-tarot.netlify.app/). Later, I started working through the [Scrimba AI Engineer Path](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-ai-engineer-path-c02v) and decided to use some of what I learned to create something of my own.

I used the [Tarot API](https://tarotapi.dev/) to get the initial data about all the cards, and the [suggested source for images](https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/xr/index.htm).  
I looked all over Dribbble, Behance and the like to research ideas on presentation, and created a moodboard, wireframes and a mini style guide in Figma (link to come).  
I also wanted to challenge myself to try something new for this project, so I used Remix instead of NextJS, and TypeScript instead of JavaScript.  
The AI portion is powered by OpenAI, and I created a Cloudflare Worker to access the API.

## Tools

Remix, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, OpenAI, Cloudflare Workers
